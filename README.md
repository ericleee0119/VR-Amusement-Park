## Introduction
Most people enjoy visiting the amusement park. There
are several amusement parks in the world and each amusement
park has its own famous facilities. It is really hard
for people to visit all amusement parks all over the world.
Therefore, I decided to implement a VR project that can let
the user could have the experience to take rides with the
Google Cardboard. Each amusement park has many kinds
of facilities, and I choose to implement the most classical
facility into my project. I built two roller coasters for my
project. This VR amusement park can let the user select
which roller coasters they are going to play.

## Design and Implementation
The below image is the architecture of my project, We have two facilities, they share the sun, the cloud,
and the light in our Unity world. And each facility has their own
objects, such as cars, buildings, etc. The independent objects can
help us to design the different features at each facility

The below image shows that we have two main code file. CameraPointer.
cs indicates the camera and the action it should do. And
the MoveCar.cs is the code indicates how the car moves. It also
provided the algorithm to adjust the Velocity
