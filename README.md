## Introduction
Most people enjoy visiting the amusement park. There
are several amusement parks in the world and each amusement
park has its own famous facilities. It is really hard
for people to visit all amusement parks all over the world.
Therefore, I decided to implement a VR project that can let
the user could have the experience to take rides with the
Google Cardboard. Each amusement park has many kinds
of facilities, and I choose to implement the most classical
facility into my project. I built two roller coasters for my
project. This VR amusement park can let the user select
which roller coasters they are going to play.
